# Moral Machine Learning Projects

This repository currently holds a PDF (and raw code) for a Moral Machine Learning Midterm (hosted in the folder titled "Midterm"). The PDF is a paper written in RMarkdown and knitted into a PDF utilizing LaTeX. The paper outlines an introduction, methods, results, and normative considerations based off the Journal article titled, "Statistical methods for the time-to-event analysis of individual participant data from multiple epidemiological studies". The link is included within said PDF (and code) files. 

Eventually, this repository will hold a Final project for Moral Machine Learning, which builds off the Midterm in hopes of expanding novel analysis to the current methods, and fleshing out the normative consideration of the paper.
