# Moral Machine Learning Projects

This repository currently holds a PDF and Rmd for a Moral Machine Learning Midterm and Final Project (both of which are in their respective folders). 

The PDFs are papers written in RMarkdown and knitted into a PDF utilizing LaTeX. The papers are inspired by the Journal article titled, "Statistical methods for the time-to-event analysis of individual participant data from multiple epidemiological studies". The link is included within said PDF (and code) files.
