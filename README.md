# Moral Machine Learning Projects
This repository currently holds a PDF and raw code for a Midterm project for Moral Machine Learning (hosted in the folder titled "Midterm"). The PDF is a paper written by Abigail Mabe in RMarkdown and knitted into a PDF utilizing LaTeX. The paper outlines Introduction, Methods, Results, and Normative Consideration sections based off the Journal article titled, "Statistical methods for the time-to-event analysis of individual participant data from multiple epidemiological studies". The link is included within said PDF and code. 
Eventually, this repository will hold a Final project for Moral Machine Learning, which builds off the Midterm in hopes of expanding novel analysis to the current methods, and fleshing out the normative consideration of the paper.
